A student wrote this script named start_lab04.sh to run before
#!/bin/sh
cd ~/labs/04
ex1=jpg2png
ex2=email_image
ex3=date_image
ex4=tag_music
But when he ran his script, it didn't seem to work:
pwd
/home/z1234567
./start_lab04.sh
pwd
/home/z1234567
echo $ex1 $ex2 $ex3 $ex4
Why not, and can you fix the shell script?
The course code for COMP2042 has been changed to COMP2042 and the course code for COMP9042 has been changed to COMP9042. Write a shell script, update_course_code.sh which appropriately changes the course_code in all the files it is given as argument.
Modify update_course_code.sh so if given a directory as argument it updates the course codes in files found in that directory and its sub-directories.
Write a shell script, is_business_hours which exits with a status of 0 if the current time is between 9am & 5pm, and otherwise exits with a status of 1.
Hint: the date command prints the current time in a format like this:

date
Sun Mar 18 12:57:08 EST 2012
CSE systems have a command, mlalias, which prints information about a specified mail alias. For example:
mlalias COMP2042-list
        alias: COMP2042-list
  description: Udb alias list
    addresses:
               z5000000
               z5000001
               .......
               z5555555
               andrewt
       owners: udb, cs2041
authorised posters: @Employee, @Subject_Utility, @Wheel
    Moderator: udb
       Status: system, closed, moderated, virtual, and public
Convert the output of the mlalias command into a new line separated list of CSE usernames, like this:
z5000000
z5000001
.......
z5555555
andrewt
CSE system have a command, acc, which prints information about a specified user. For example:
acc z5555555
            User Name : z5555555              Aliases :
                  Uid : 25068

Write a pipeline which converts the output of acc into a new line separated list of courses the person is enrolled in, like this:
COMP2042
COMP2121
COMP2511
COMP3900
Make sure you don't include COMP1511 which Michael tutors.
Use the pipeines from the above 2 questions to write shell commands which print a list of courses taken by COMP2042 students with counts of how many COMP2042 students take each, like this:

     55 COMP2911
     37 COMP2121
     17 COMP3311
     10 COMP2111
      9 COMP3331

COMP2042 student Shruti has a 'friends' subdirectory in her home directory that contains images of her many friends. Shruti likes to view these images often and would like to have them appear in other directories within her CSE account so she has written a shell script to symbolically link them to the current directory:
for image_file in `ls ~/friends`
do
    ln -s "~/friends/$image_file" .
done
The links created by Shruti's script are broken. Why? How can she fix her script?

Write a shell script named isprime which given an integer as argment, tests whether it is prime and prints a suitable message:
isprime 42
42 is not prime
isprime 113
113 is prime
Your script should exit with a non-zero exit status if its argument is not prime.
Write a second script named primes which uses the first script to print all primes less than a specified value, e.g:

primes 100
2
3
5
7
11
13
17
...
79
83

Revision questions
The remaining tutorial questions are primarily intended for revision - either this week or later in session.
Your tutor may still choose to cover some of the questions time permitting.

COMP2042 student Big Bad Barry tries to impress a girl at a party by betting her she can't work out what this shell script:
#!/bin/sh
IFS=abc
echo "$*"
prints when run like this:

./script.sh mount inside
What does the script print?

Will the girl go out with Big Bad Barry?
